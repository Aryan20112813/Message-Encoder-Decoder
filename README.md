🔐 Message Encoder and Decoder
Hide your secrets in plain sight – and decode them like a pro!
Ever wondered how secret messages work? This project is your first step into the world of encryption and decryption!
Message Encoder and Decoder is a fun and interactive tool that transforms your normal text into secret codes — and then brings it back to readable form.

🧠 Why I Built It:
As a 2nd-year Computer Engineering student, I wanted to build something that’s both educational and exciting. This project helped me understand the basics of data encryption, string manipulation, and logic building.
<br>
💡 Features:
Convert normal text into a secret message
Decode the secret message back to normal text
Easy-to-use and beginner-friendly
Written in C++
<br>
🚀 Purpose:
Made as a part of a college project to learn about encryption, decryption, and how messages can be safely sent or stored.
